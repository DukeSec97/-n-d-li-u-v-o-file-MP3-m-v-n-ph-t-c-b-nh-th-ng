Hide Data in MP3 Files and Still Play It

Description

This tutorial will show you how to embed hidden data in MP3 files using two methods:

1. Insert data into metadata (ID3 Tag) â€“ Hide information in the MP3 metadata.

2. Embed data at the end of MP3 file â€“ Add information to the end of the file while still keeping the ability to play music.


=> Requirements

Before starting, you need to install the Python library:

pip install mutagen
=> Insert data into metadata (ID3 Tag)

Data will be hidden in the ID3 Tag of MP3.


ðŸ”¹ Implementation code

from mutagen.id3 import ID3, TXXX
import shutil

# Original MP3 file path
input_file = "input.mp3"
output_file = "metadata_hidden.mp3"

# Create a copy of the original file for editing
shutil.copy(input_file, output_file)

# Insert hidden data into metadata
tags = ID3(output_file)
tags.add(TXXX(encoding=3, desc="HiddenInfo", text="Safe hidden data"))
tags.save(output_file)

print(f"Data

=> Embed data at the end of the MP3 file

Data will be written at the end of the file, marked for easy extraction.

ðŸ”¹ Implementation code

# Input and output file paths
appended_file = "appended_hidden.mp3"

# Make a copy before embedding data
shutil.copy(output_file, appended_file)

# Data to hide
hidden_data_marker = b"\n--HIDDEN-DATA--\nSECRET_PAYLOAD_1234567890\n--END--\n"

# Write data at the end of the file
with open(appended_file, "ab") as f:
f.write(hidden_data_marker)

print(f"Data has been embedded at the end of the file {appended_file}")

=> Extract the hidden data

To retrieve the hidden data, just read the end of the MP3 file.

ðŸ”¹ Implementation code

# Read the end of the file
with open(appended_file, "rb") as f:
content = f.read()

# Find hidden data with marker
start_marker = b"--HIDDEN-DATA--"
end_marker = b"--END--"

start = content.find(start_marker)
end = content.find(end_marker)

if start != -1 and end != -1:
hidden_data = content[start + len(start_marker): end].strip()
print(f"Hidden data: {hidden_data.decode()}")
else:
print("Hidden data not found")

---

=>Result

The MP3 file can still be played normally.

The data has been embedded in the metadata and at the end of the file.

It can be easily extracted again.
